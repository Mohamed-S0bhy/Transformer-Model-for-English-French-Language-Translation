# Transformer Model for English-French Translation

### This repository contains a Transformer-based model designed for English-to-French language translation. The project showcases the following components:

- Data Preparation: Loading, shuffling, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Tokenization and Indexing: Using TensorFlow's TextVectorization for tokenizing and indexing text data with custom standardization functions.
- Positional Embedding: Implementing a custom PositionalEmbedding layer to add positional information to token embeddings.
- Multi-Head Attention: Utilizing the MultiHeadAttention layer to capture complex dependencies between words.
- Encoder and Decoder: Building Transformer Encoder and Decoder layers with attention and feed-forward networks.
- Model Compilation and Training: Compiling the model with RMSprop optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss, and training it with early stopping and learning rate adjustment.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on the test set and translating sentences from English to French.
- Translation Example: Demonstrating translations of sample sentences using the trained model.
- The code includes detailed explanations and examples to guide users through the model's architecture and training process."
